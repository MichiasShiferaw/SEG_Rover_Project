/**
 * A class representing a Roverâ€™s mobility implementation. This class has common traits of a Rover such as its current state represented by an enum (a special collection) value as well as another
 *  enum to indicate whether the Rover's engine is running or not. The Rover machine also has a plethora of behaviors like by pressing the left pedal once, it will accelerate forward or press both
 *  pedals simultaneously, the Rover will brake). Each method below represents the behaviour of a Rover.
